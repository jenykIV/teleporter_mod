## Documentation
### how to use
#### teleporter
If you place the teleporter and open its gui, hovering over some slots will tell you what to do. Craft a cartridge, click a block and put the cartridge in the teleporter. After adding fuel (lapis) you should be able to teleport. Note that you will need enough lapis, since cost is distance related. Also, you wont teleport unless the destination is unoccupied. The base cost is 0.01 lapis per block.
#### upgrades
adding upgrades to your teleporter modifies the behavior. Should be pretty self-explanatory, since they have decent tooltips. Simply add them to corresponding slots (marked with up-facing arrows). Stacking is possible with all combinations.

The most difference is for the Item upgrade, since it disables entity teleportation. Feed items to the mail slot, wait until the lock dissapears and see your itemstack spawned in the location. Teleportation cost is now proportional to stack size and distance, with corellation of 0.001 per 64-item stack. Be careful when teleporting to unloaded chunks since that may destroy the itemstack. Feeding is possible with hoppers, but you will need to fill the remaining slots with something.
